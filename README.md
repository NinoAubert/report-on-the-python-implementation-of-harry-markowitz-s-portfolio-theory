# Report on the Python Implementation of Harry Markowitz's Portfolio Theory

## Introduction
>This portfolio optimization project was born from my desire to practically apply the financial theories I acquired during my research. I wanted to go beyond theoretical concepts by implementing Harry Markowitz's Modern Portfolio Theory using a powerful programming tool: Python. 
>By leveraging the NumPy, Pandas, and scipy.optimize libraries, this project allows me to explore the following concepts: 
>* Constructing a diversified asset portfolio 
>* Calculating returns and risks using the covariance matrix 
>* Optimizing asset weights to maximize the Sharpe ratio 
>* Simulating portfolios to visualize the efficient frontier
